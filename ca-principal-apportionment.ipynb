    "# California State-Level Funding for Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general overview of how public schools in California recieve government funding for education, which is divided into the specific educational programs. The main source of funding for a school is known as the Principal Apportionment.\n",

    "#### The __Principal Apportionment__ provides categorical funding for LEAs, including... \n",
    "1. Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) -- this is the primary source of general purpose funding for an LEA \n",

    "\n",
    "How much funding a school gets is determined by various factors, including the equity multiplier and the amount of children who actually attend the school everyday, a metric called ADA, or Average Daily Attendance.\n",

    "#### __Key Terms__:\n",
    "* LEA: _Local Educational Agency_ \n",
    "    - an LEA is the public authority responsible for providing education in an area; typically a school, county office of education, or public school district.\n",
    "* ADA: _Average Daily Attendance_\n",
    "    - This is a measurement of how many kids on average attend a school--this goes into the formula which determines how much funding a school gets.\n",
    "* AB: _[California] Assembly Bill_\n",
    "    - Specific bills determine how funding is sourced, categorized and allocated.\n",
    "* SELPA: _Special Education Local Plan Area_\n",
    "    - Coordinators of Special Education for a certain area, sometimes a district.\n",
    "* LCFF: _Local Control Funding Formula_\n",
